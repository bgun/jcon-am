  <h2>JordanCon a.m.</h2>
  <h1>After Midnight</h1>
  <p>
  Saturday night, 11:45pm until late.
  </p>
  <p>
  READ THIS FIRST. Room number is at the bottom.
  </p>
  <p>
  After Midnight is a room party Saturday night of JordanCon, during/after the big dance party downstairs. Feeling overstimulated from the ground floor chaos but don't want to turn in just yet? We feel you.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is a downtempo chill space for conversation, decompression, and grounding. If queer / trans / neurodivergent spaces are not commonplace for you, de-center yourself and come correct.
  </p>
  <p>
  There will be downtempo music/lo-fi beats and some snacks/drinks. Bring your favorites to share.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No shoes.</li>
    <li>No being shitfaced.</li>
    <li>Avoid being the loudest person in the room.</li>
    <li><a href="https://umatter.princeton.edu/respect/consent">Understanding consent</a> is sexy, it is mandatory, and it is JordanCon policy. Take care of each other.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  See you soon!
