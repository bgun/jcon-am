JordanCon a.m. (after midnight)
===============================

Saturday night, 11:45pm until late.


READ THIS FIRST. Room number is at the bottom.


After Midnight is a room party Saturday night of JordanCon, during/after the big dance party downstairs. Feeling overstimulated from the ground floor chaos but don't want to turn in just yet? We feel you.

This is a downtempo chill space for conversation, decompression, and grounding. If queer / trans / neurodivergent spaces are not commonplace for you, de-center yourself and come correct.

There will be downtempo music/lo-fi beats and some snacks/drinks. Bring your favorites to share.

 - No shoes.
 - No being shitfaced.
 - Avoid being the loudest person in the room.

[Understanding consent](https://umatter.princeton.edu/respect/consent) is sexy, it is mandatory, and it is JordanCon policy. Take care of each other.

See you soon.
