JordanCon a.m. (after midnight)
===============================

Saturday night, 11:45pm until late.


READ THIS FIRST. Room number is at the bottom.


This is a room party Saturday night of JordanCon, during/after the big dance party downstairs. Feeling overstimulated from the ground floor chaos but don't want to turn in just yet? We feel you.

This is a chill/relax/sanctuary space for conversation, decompression, and grounding. If queer/trans/neurodivergent-forward spaces are not commonplace for you, de-center yourself and come correct.

There will be downtempo music/lo-fi beats and some snacks/drinks. Bring some of your own.

 - No shoes.
 - No being shitfaced.
 - Avoid being the loudest person in the room.

If strangers giving each other massages / sensory play / light shibari could put you in a challenged headspace, consider other alternatives for your evening entertainment.

See you soon.
